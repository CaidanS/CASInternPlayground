# Computational Actuarial Science

Computational actuarial science is severly underexplored.

Put .ipynb files in here. Questions to answer - 

* How much space will it take up in a computer to calculate `P policies` over `T timesteps` and `N scenarios`. I think it is PxTxN, is it? In terms of space on the actual computer (in GB) how much is this going to take up?
* Do we need the "full cube" to do the calculation? Or can we do intermediate aggregations to reduce the overall space required? How does this impact the time it takes to run the simulations?
